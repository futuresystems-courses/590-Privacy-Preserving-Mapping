--Report Part--
The final report can be found in report/
We have submitted our final report to IU Canvas also through Lei Wang's account, plz check it.
We have included the same final report under PrivacyPreservingMapping/report/ as well.

--How to run the code--
DETAILS are in the Manual part of my final report, which provides a screenshot for every step.

First, cd 'src/splitfiles', and run './build.sh' for the processing part
Second, cd 'src/readsmapping', and put a query string in 'query.fa', then run './buildAndRun.sh' for the Hadoop part
Third, cd $PPM/output and less part-r-00000  to see the result
